# Quickstart

After you've [installed](./install.md) oranda, it's time to give it a spin. Make sure you can execute the
`oranda` command, its output should look something like this:

```
$ oranda
üéÅ generate beautiful landing pages for your projects

Usage: oranda [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
build
dev
serve
help Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
-h, --help Print help (see more with '--help')
-V, --version Print version

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
--verbose <VERBOSE> How verbose logging should be (log level) [default: warn] [possible values:
off, error, warn, info, debug, trace]
--output-format <OUTPUT_FORMAT> The format of the output [default: human] [possible values: human, json]
```

Since `oranda` is designed to work without configuration, the quickest start is to just run `oranda dev` in an
existing project with at least a `README.md` file! This will spawn a web server that serves your site, plus
an extra process that watches for changes in files relevant to `oranda`'s build process.

## In a Cargo project

`oranda` integrates with Cargo projects seamlessly. `oranda build` will pick up relevant
metadata from your `Cargo.toml` file automatically, including [`cargo-dist`] configuration,
if you have that set up.

## In a Node project

If you use Node.js, oranda can not only be installed via npm, but also supports reading metadata
from your package manifest file. Additionally, npm scripts make it easy to integrate `oranda` into
your workflows, for example like this:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:site": "oranda build"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@axodotdev/oranda": "~0.3.0"
  }
}
```

## Further Steps

- Explore the [`oranda` configuration options](./configuration.md)
- Read the [CLI docs](./cli.md)
- Learn more about [hosting `oranda` sites](./hosting.md)
